# Amazon Clone — Static Demo

This is a small, static demo of an Amazon-like storefront (for learning and prototyping only).

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — product data and UI logic

How to run:
- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the static demo.
- For a local server (recommended to avoid some browser restrictions):

  PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  cd c:\Users\mheark\Desktop\website
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

  Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Notes:
- This is a demo and not a production-ready clone of Amazon. No backend or payment processing included.
- Product images use placeholder images from `https://via.placeholder.com`.

You can extend this by adding product pages, authentication, or connecting a backend API.
